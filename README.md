Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provides a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, as the p-value is 5.35e-11 (lower than 0.05).

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - The dataset shows that the multiple R-squared is 0.7149 (which is 71.49%). With that percentage it can predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively
